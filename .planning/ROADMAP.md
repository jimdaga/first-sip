### 🚧 v1.1 Plugin Architecture (In Progress)

**Milestone Goal:** Transform First Sip from monolithic briefing generator into a modular, user-configurable plugin platform where each briefing type runs on its own schedule with its own CrewAI workflow.

**Phase Numbering:** Continues from v1.0 (last phase was 7).

**Research Flags:**
- **Phase 9 (CrewAI):** Needs deeper research before planning — CrewAI 2026 production patterns
- **Phase 12 (Settings):** Needs research on JSON Schema extension field preservation

---

#### Phase 8: Plugin Framework Foundation
**Goal**: Plugin metadata system with database-backed registry and end-to-end working example plugin
**Depends on**: v1.0 infrastructure
**Requirements**: PLUG-01, PLUG-02, PLUG-03, PLUG-04, PLUG-05, PLUG-06
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Plugin metadata defined in YAML files with name, description, version, default settings schema
  2. Plugin registry discovers and loads all plugins from `/plugins` directory at startup
  3. Plugin, UserPluginConfig, and PluginRun database models exist with GORM migrations applied
  4. Schema versioning field exists in plugin metadata and templates handle missing fields with defaults
  5. At least one example plugin (daily news digest) exists with complete metadata and settings schema
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 08-01: TBD
- [ ] 08-02: TBD

---

#### Phase 9: CrewAI Sidecar Integration
**Goal**: Go-to-CrewAI communication pipeline working end-to-end with real multi-agent workflow execution
**Depends on**: Phase 8
**Requirements**: CREW-01, CREW-02, CREW-03, CREW-04, CREW-05, CREW-06, CREW-07
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. FastAPI Python sidecar service runs with health check endpoint responding
  2. Go publishes plugin execution requests to Redis Stream and CrewAI consumes them
  3. CrewAI multi-agent workflow executes (researcher → writer → reviewer pattern) and publishes results to response stream
  4. Go worker consumes CrewAI results from Redis Stream and creates Briefing records in database
  5. Long-running AI workflows timeout gracefully after configurable duration (no hung processes)
  6. CrewAI pods scale independently from Go workers in Kubernetes deployment
**Research Flag**: Needs deeper research before planning — CrewAI 2026 production patterns, agent configuration, error handling
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 09-01: TBD
- [ ] 09-02: TBD

#### Phase 10: Per-User Scheduling
**Goal**: Database-backed per-user per-plugin scheduling replaces global cron with timezone support
**Depends on**: Phase 9
**Requirements**: SCHED-01, SCHED-02, SCHED-03, SCHED-04, SCHED-05, SCHED-06
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Each user can configure unique schedule per plugin (cron expression + timezone stored in UserPluginConfig)
  2. Per-minute scheduler task evaluates database for due user-plugin pairs (NOT per-user Asynq cron entries)
  3. Schedule matching respects user's local timezone (user in PST sees 6 AM PST, not 6 AM UTC)
  4. Global cron scheduler removed — all briefing generation driven by per-user per-plugin schedules
  5. Redis caches last-run times to reduce database load during per-minute evaluation
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 10-01: TBD
- [ ] 10-02: TBD

---

#### Phase 11: Tile-Based Dashboard
**Goal**: CSS Grid tile layout displays all enabled plugins with latest briefing and status
**Depends on**: Phase 10
**Requirements**: TILE-01, TILE-02, TILE-03, TILE-04, TILE-05, TILE-06
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Dashboard displays tiles in CSS Grid layout (auto-fit/minmax responsive, no JavaScript masonry)
  2. Each enabled plugin renders as tile showing plugin name, latest briefing summary, and status badge
  3. Tile displays last run time and next scheduled run in user's timezone
  4. Dashboard pre-fetches latest briefing per plugin in single query (window function, avoids N+1)
  5. Empty states display gracefully (no plugins enabled shows prompt, plugin enabled but no briefings shows waiting state)
  6. HTMX updates tile status in-place when briefing generation completes
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 11-01: TBD
- [ ] 11-02: TBD

---

#### Phase 12: Dynamic Settings UI
**Goal**: Settings page with plugin management, auto-generated forms from JSON Schema, and validation
**Depends on**: Phase 11
**Requirements**: SET-01, SET-02, SET-03, SET-04, SET-05, SET-06
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Settings page lists all available plugins with enable/disable toggle per plugin
  2. Forms generate dynamically from each plugin's JSON Schema settings definition (no manual form coding)
  3. kaptinlin/jsonschema validates settings with inline field-level error display
  4. HTML form string inputs coerce to JSON Schema types (integer, boolean) without validation errors
  5. Form preserves user's input on validation errors (re-render with submitted values, not defaults)
  6. Plugin status info displays on settings page (last run, next run, recent error count)
**Research Flag**: Needs research on JSON Schema extension field preservation (x-component, x-placeholder)
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 12-01: TBD
- [ ] 12-02: TBD

---

#### Phase 13: Account Tier Scaffolding
**Goal**: Tier-based constraint enforcement for plugin count and frequency limits (scaffolding only, no payment)
**Depends on**: Phase 12
**Requirements**: TIER-01, TIER-02, TIER-03, TIER-04, TIER-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. AccountTier model exists with free and pro tiers seeded in database
  2. User model has AccountTierID relationship (defaults to free tier on registration)
  3. Tier service checks constraints (max enabled plugins, max frequency) server-side
  4. Plugin enable handler rejects enable request when user reaches tier limit
  5. UI displays upgrade messaging when user approaches or reaches tier limit
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 13-01: TBD
- [ ] 13-02: TBD
